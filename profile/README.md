Awas Judol! is an educational web-based application about online gambling that consists of gamification learning contents in form of quizzes. This application provides a bottom-up solution as a preventive way to educate teenagers about the risks that came along with online gambling. Generative AI is used to create the questions related to the story on each level. Each level has the same topic of questions but can be generated differently on different user.
